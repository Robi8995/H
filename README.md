## üéØ Project Objective

**Objective:** Analyze hospital stay duration, patient demographics, and readmission patterns to identify length-of-stay drivers, segment patient populations by risk level, discover diagnosis-specific care complexity, and evaluate admission type impacts‚Äîenabling data-driven resource planning, cost optimization, preventive care strategies, and operational efficiency improvements for healthcare administrators and clinical teams.

**Dataset:** `hospital_stay_data.csv` | **Industry:** Healthcare Analytics & Hospital Operations

**Problem Statement:**

Hospital administrators and clinical teams face challenges in optimizing resource allocation, predicting patient outcomes, and reducing readmission rates without comprehensive data insights. Key questions remain unanswered: Which patient demographics drive longer stays? How do diagnoses and comorbidities influence care complexity and costs? What factors predict 30-day readmissions? How do admission types impact outcomes and resource utilization? Without data-driven analysis, hospitals risk inefficient bed allocation, unexpected readmissions, suboptimal patient outcomes, and rising operational costs. This project provides comprehensive patient risk analysis, length-of-stay prediction insights, diagnosis profiling, and readmission risk stratification to optimize clinical workflows, improve patient outcomes, reduce preventable readmissions, and maximize operational efficiency.

## üìà Key Findings

### Overall Market Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Admissions Analyzed** | ~9,000 |
| **Average Length of Stay** | ~5.2 days |
| **Median Length of Stay** | ~4 days |
| **Stay Duration Range** | 1-100+ days |
| **Average Total Bill** | ~$42,500 |
| **Readmission Rate (30-day)** | ~22% |
| **Age Range** | 18-95 years |

**Insight:** Hospital stays show right-skewed distribution with median below mean, indicating outlier cases with extended stays inflating averages. Readmission rate of 22% presents significant opportunity for preventive intervention and post-discharge care optimization.

### Length of Stay by Admission Type

**Key Finding:** Emergency admissions drive longest hospital stays with 2.4√ó longer duration than elective cases, indicating higher clinical complexity and acute care requirements.

- **Emergency:** Average 7.8 days, highest resource intensity, highest readmission risk
- **Urgent:** Average 5.2 days, moderate complexity, moderate readmission risk
- **Elective:** Average 3.2 days, lowest complexity, lowest readmission risk

**Insight:** Admission pathway directly impacts care requirements and operational burden. Emergency cases represent 45% of admissions but consume disproportionate resources. Elective procedures demonstrate optimized workflows with shorter, predictable stays.

**Operational Implication:** Resource planning should prioritize capacity for emergency cases; elective scheduling can support operational efficiency through predictable resource allocation.

### Top 10 Diagnoses by Average Stay Duration

| Rank | Diagnosis | Avg Stay (Days) | Complexity |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Cardiac Disorders | 9.2 | High |
| 2 | Renal Failure | 8.7 | High |
| 3 | Sepsis | 8.3 | High |
| 4 | Stroke/TIA | 7.9 | High |
| 5 | COPD Exacerbation | 7.1 | High |
| 6 | Pneumonia | 6.8 | Moderate |
| 7 | Hip Fracture | 6.5 | Moderate |
| 8 | Diabetes Complications | 5.9 | Moderate |
| 9 | GI Bleed | 5.4 | Moderate |
| 10 | Appendicitis | 4.2 | Moderate |

**Insight:** Cardiac and renal conditions command 2‚Äì3√ó longer stays versus citywide average, indicating significantly higher care complexity. These diagnoses require specialized interventions, intensive monitoring, and multi-disciplinary care teams. Identifying these high-complexity cases early enables proactive resource allocation and specialist involvement.

### Patient Demographics & Age Analysis

**Finding:** Age concentration between 40-65 years represents 65% of all hospitalizations, with significant increases in average stay duration for patients 70+.

- **Age 18-30:** Average stay 2.8 days, predominantly elective procedures, low readmission
- **Age 31-50:** Average stay 3.9 days, mixed admission types, moderate readmission
- **Age 51-70:** Average stay 5.8 days, emergency cases increase, higher readmission
- **Age 71-95:** Average stay 7.2 days, highest emergency rate, highest readmission (28%)

**Insight:** Older patients (70+) experience 2.5√ó longer stays than younger cohorts. Age combined with multiple comorbidities creates compounded risk. This population requires enhanced discharge planning and post-discharge follow-up.

### Comorbidity Impact Analysis

**Finding:** Each additional chronic condition increases average length of stay by ~1.5 days and total bill by ~18%.

- **0 Comorbidities:** Avg stay 3.2 days, avg bill $18,500
- **1-2 Comorbidities:** Avg stay 4.8 days, avg bill $28,300 (+53%)
- **3-5 Comorbidities:** Avg stay 6.4 days, avg bill $38,700 (+109%)
- **6+ Comorbidities:** Avg stay 8.1 days, avg bill $52,400 (+183%)

**Insight:** Comorbidity burden is a powerful predictor of care complexity and costs. Patients with multiple chronic conditions require coordinated specialty care and longer recovery periods. Early identification of high-comorbidity patients enables proactive care management.

### Readmission Risk by Admission Type

| Admission Type | Readmission Rate | Risk Level | Key Driver |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Emergency** | 29% | High | Acute decompensation, inadequate outpatient follow-up |
| **Urgent** | 18% | Moderate | Transitional care gaps, medication management |
| **Elective** | 8% | Low | Planned procedures, optimized pre-discharge coordination |

**Insight:** Emergency patients show 3.6√ó higher readmission rate than elective cases. Early discharge from emergency admissions correlates with higher readmission‚Äîsuggesting optimization opportunity through enhanced post-discharge monitoring and care coordination. Elective procedures demonstrate best practices for discharge planning and low readmission rates.

### Correlation Analysis

| Variable Pair | Correlation | Clinical Significance |
|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Length of Stay ‚Üî Total Bill** | 0.72 (Strong) | Direct cost driver; longer stays = higher costs |
| **Comorbidities ‚Üî Stay Duration** | 0.45 (Moderate) | Multiple conditions increase complexity |
| **Age ‚Üî Stay Duration** | 0.38 (Moderate) | Older patients require longer recovery |
| **Comorbidities ‚Üî Total Bill** | 0.68 (Strong) | Multi-disease management increases costs |

**Insight:** Length of stay is primary cost driver. Comorbidity burden influences both stay duration and total costs, suggesting opportunity for early intervention in patients with multiple chronic conditions to reduce hospital utilization and costs.

### Price Distribution Analysis

| Length of Stay | Admission Count | % of Total | Segment | Avg Bill |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **1-3 days** | 3,240 | 36% | Short-stay (Routine) | $12,800 |
| **4-7 days** | 3,690 | 41% | Standard (Expected) | $32,500 |
| **8-14 days** | 1,458 | 16% | Extended (Complex) | $58,300 |
| **15+ days** | 612 | 7% | Prolonged (Critical) | $98,700 |

**Insight:** Market bifurcated into routine (36%) and standard (41%) stays with 23% extended/prolonged cases. Prolonged stays (15+ days) generate 7.7√ó higher bills despite representing only 7% of admissions, indicating high-value intervention opportunity.
